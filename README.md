Bike Sales Data Analysis
This project involves the cleaning, analysis, and visualization of a bike dataset in Excel. I transformed the raw data to make it more insightful by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating a user-friendly dashboard using pivot tables.

Project Overview
This project includes the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and missing values.
Data Transformation and Analysis: Organized and transformed data for easy analysis.
Data Visualization: Built visualizations using pivot tables to highlight key insights.
Dashboard Creation: Created an interactive dashboard in Excel to summarize the main findings.
Steps
1. Data Cleaning
Duplicate Removal: I identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
Handling Missing Values: For columns with missing values, I either filled in reasonable defaults or removed the rows based on the relevance of the missing data.
Formatting Adjustments: Adjusted date formats and standardized text fields for consistency, which made the data easier to analyze and visualize.
2. Data Transformation and Analysis
To make the dataset more useful for analysis, I performed:

Column Renaming: Renamed columns for clarity (e.g., changing "BikeBuyer" to "Is_Bike_Buyer").
Calculated Fields: Added calculated fields to derive additional insights, such as income brackets or commute distance categories.
Categorization: Categorized customer demographics (e.g., age groups and income brackets) to identify trends in bike purchasing behavior.
3. Data Visualization
Using Pivot Tables in Excel, I created multiple visualizations to explore and display key insights:

Bike Purchases by Age Group: Analyzed the average age of customers who purchased bikes.
Average Commute Distance: Explored how commute distance affects bike purchasing likelihood.
Income vs. Bike Purchase: Examined the correlation between income levels and bike purchases.
4. Dashboard Creation
The final step was creating a Dashboard in Excel to bring all the insights together in a single, easy-to-navigate view:

Interactive Filters: Added slicers and filters for age group, income level, and commute distance to allow for dynamic analysis.
Data Summary: Created a high-level summary of the key metrics, including total bikes sold, top purchasing demographics, and most popular commute distances.
Visual Elements: Used charts, graphs, and color-coding to make the dashboard visually engaging and intuitive to understand.
Results
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of bike sales trends, with insights into customer demographics and purchase patterns. This project demonstrates the power of Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in a business context.
